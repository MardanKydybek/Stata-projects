Impact of Population Aging on CO2 Emissions: A Global Panel Data Analysis (1990–2024)
Project Overview
This research explores the relationship between demographic shifts and environmental outcomes. Using a panel dataset of 194 countries, I test the "Mobility Effect" hypothesis—suggesting that as populations age, aggregate carbon footprints decrease due to changes in consumption and labor-related mobility.

Key Methodology
Model: Two-Way Fixed Effects (FE) Regression with Country and Time effects.
Robustness: Addressed heteroscedasticity using Huber-White robust standard errors (vce(robust)) and tested for cross-sectional dependence using Pesaran’s CD test.
Factor Comparison: Conducted a comparative analysis between Population Share 65+ and Median Age, identifying a high multicollinearity (r=0.915) and justifying the selection of the 65+ metric for higher statistical power.
Principal Findings
A 1 percentage point increase in the population aged 65+ is associated with a 6.9% decrease in per capita CO

While GDP and urbanization remain primary drivers of emissions, demographic aging acts as a significant structural mitigator.
Tools Used
Stata: Econometric modeling and diagnostic testing.
