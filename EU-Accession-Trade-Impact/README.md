Impact of EU Accession on Eastern European Exports
Project Overview
This project estimates the causal effect of European Union membership on the export performance of Eastern European countries using a Structural Gravity Model.

Key Findings
Trade Creation: EU accession is associated with a 33.2% increase in bilateral exports, holding GDP and distance constant.
Statistical Significance: The treatment effect (post_accession) is significant at the 1% level (p<0.01).
Methodology
Model: Log-linear OLS Gravity Model.
Data Sources: CEPII BACI and Gravity Databases (1990-2020).
Software: Stata.
Variables
Dependent: ln_trade (Log of bilateral export values).
Independent: ln_gdp (Economic mass), ln_dist (Trade costs), contig (Geographic proximity), post_accession (Time-varying policy dummy).
